# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Challenge

## Challenge Description
A completed website was given to be refactored to improve accessibility without changing the appearance of the website.

### Commit 1
> Fixed title, added semantic elements, fixed nav css

The title was changed from "website" to the name featured on the website, Horiseon. The HTML used div elements to structure the webpage. These were all replaced with semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility, excluding one with the "hero" class which is only a decorative image. The CSS for the navigation bar was changed to reflect the HTML change from a div to a nav element.

### Commit 2
> Add alt attributes

All images in the HTML were given descriptive alt attributes to improve accessibility.

### Commit 3
> Added comments

Comments were added in the HTML and CSS to improve readability and understanding.

### Commit 4
> Created README

### Commit 5
> fixed seo link

The article with the "search-engine-optimization" class had a broken link, which was fixed by adding an id to the article.

### Commit 6
> finalized readme
